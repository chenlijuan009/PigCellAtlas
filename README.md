# PigCellAtlas
Cells are the functional intermediaries linking genotypes to phenotypes. However, the systematic characterization of cellular heterogeneity among tissues and cell-type-specific regulation of complex phenotypes are still understudied in pigs.Within the Pig Genotype-Tissue Expression (PigGTEx) project, we here present a single-cell atlas of adult pigs.

# Title:
Construction of a multi-tissue cell atlas reveals cell-type-specific regulation of molecular and complex phenotypes in pigs
